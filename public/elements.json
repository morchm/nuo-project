This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. All those little son of a guns. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Imagination is the key to painting. Imagination is the key to painting. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Let your imagination be your guide. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it."

There we go. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. You can create anything that makes you happy. The least little bit can do so much. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend."

Just float around and be there. In this world, everything can be happy. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. We can fix anything. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. You gotta think like a tree. Happy painting, God bless. This is the fun part God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light."
